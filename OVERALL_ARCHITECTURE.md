# Overall Implementation Architecture

## Scope
- Freeze the stable implementation boundaries that currently realize QwenPaw in this repository.
- Materialize the `sec-e2e-024`, `sec-e2e-025`, `sec-e2e-027`, `sec-e2e-028`, `sec-e2e-021`, and `sec-e2e-029` explicit acceptance entrypoints as repository-owned, read-only testcase bodies plus their harness abstractions.
- Constrain the explicit security slice to a real-environment acceptance baseline that uses the live app subprocess, real HTTP surfaces, isolated working directories, and a separately contracted cloud-side Security Center boundary.
- Record where intent is already directly implemented, where current code only provides transitional evidence, and which gaps are intentionally handed to Coding/Repair.

## Stable Elements
- path: src/qwenpaw
  kind: RuntimeRoot
  implements:
    - intent-backend-runtime
  contract: src/qwenpaw/ARCHITECTURE.md
  role: Python runtime root that owns backend orchestration, channel/runtime glue, packaged CLI surfaces, and the stable child security boundary.

- path: src/qwenpaw/security
  kind: SecurityAuditFoundation
  implements:
    - intent-local-security-audit-foundation
    - intent-high-risk-tool-guard
  contract: src/qwenpaw/security/ARCHITECTURE.md
  role: Stable backend-owned boundary for trusted security context provenance, high-risk confirmation evidence, local audit-chain semantics, heartbeat/uplink evidence emission, lease-aware reconnect gating, normal-offline reconnect admission, and the local projection/query seam consumed by `sec-e2e-024`, `sec-e2e-025`, `sec-e2e-027`, and `sec-e2e-028`.

- path: src/qwenpaw/cli
  kind: OperatorCli
  implements:
    - intent-local-operator-cli
  contract: src/qwenpaw/cli/ARCHITECTURE.md
  role: Local operator command surface mounted under the `qwenpaw` entrypoint.

- path: console
  kind: OperatorConsole
  implements:
    - intent-console-frontend
  contract: console/ARCHITECTURE.md
  role: Browser and desktop-oriented operator console built with Vite, React, and Tauri assets.

- path: website
  kind: DocumentationSite
  implements:
    - intent-docs-website
  contract: website/ARCHITECTURE.md
  role: Public documentation and adoption website.

- path: tests
  kind: VerificationSuite
  contract: tests/ARCHITECTURE.md
  role: Physical owner of explicit testcase entrypoints, business-readable security harnesses, and architecture guardrail tests.

- path: tests/integration/security
  kind: ExplicitSecurityEntrypointZone
  contract: tests/integration/security/ARCHITECTURE.md
  role: Read-only explicit security acceptance entrypoints and harness abstractions whose bodies are written for business readability rather than plumbing detail.

- path: deploy
  kind: SecurityCenterDeploymentBoundary
  implements:
    - intent-security-center
    - intent-cloud-integrity-stub
    - intent-security-event-ingestion-v1
  contract: deploy/ARCHITECTURE.md
  role: Stable repository-owned contract boundary for the physically separate Security Center service, including a cloud-side HTTP API backend, an operator-facing web frontend, SSE or WebSocket alert delivery to operators, the integrity mirror seam consumed only through edge-to-cloud HTTP, and the Security Event Ingestion V1 intake/inbox capability for configured internal systems.

- path: deploy/config/security-event-contracts.v1.json
  kind: SecurityEventContractConfig
  implements:
    - intent-security-event-contract-config
  role: Repository-owned V1 configuration artifact for enabled source systems, allowed event types, schema versions, payload field validation, list-display metadata, and bounded failure/raw-payload display limits.

- path: .github/validator
  kind: BootstrapAssetZone
  implements:
    - intent-architecture-validator
  contract: .github/validator/ARCHITECTURE.md
  role: Schema and handoff validator scripts invoked by repository-native npm validation commands.

## Dependency Direction
- `src/qwenpaw/app`, channels, and runner glue may capture transport/session metadata, but `src/qwenpaw/security` owns the stable semantics for trusted provenance, confirmation evidence, and audit continuity. Transport layers must not redefine the acceptance boundary for `sec-e2e-024`.
- `src/qwenpaw/security` must not depend on `console` or `website` implementation details.
- `src/qwenpaw/security` may uplink summaries toward the `deploy` boundary, but the cloud-side Security Center must remain a separate process and independent durable store rather than an in-process branch of the edge runtime.
- `src/qwenpaw/security` owns the canonical runtime client identity used at the cloud boundary for lease heartbeat, recovery preflight, lockdown, restored-access projection, and operator timeline reads. Browser or session ids may remain edge-side audit metadata or display aliases, but they must not increase Security Center `client_count`, become separate canonical terminals, or create a false `DIVERGED`/`OPEN` fork state for one live runtime.
- Edge runtime communication with `deploy` is frozen to repository-owned HTTP APIs only. Coding/Repair must not switch this slice to shared storage, direct database access, or a different transport without a new implementation-architecture change.
- `src/qwenpaw/cli` depends inward on stable runtime and config surfaces in `src/qwenpaw` and does not own backend orchestration state.
- `tests` and `tests/integration/security` may observe all stable elements through declared seams; production code must not depend on test modules.
- `.github/validator` validates design assets and testcase execution wiring but does not own product behavior.

## Intent Realization Mapping
- direct implementation: `src/qwenpaw` realizes `intent-backend-runtime`.
- direct implementation: `src/qwenpaw/security` realizes `intent-local-security-audit-foundation` and its child `intent-high-risk-tool-guard`.
- indirect implementation chain: `src/qwenpaw/app/agent_context.py` provides current contextvars evidence for `intent-implicit-security-context-manager` under the owning `src/qwenpaw/security` contract.
- indirect implementation chain: `src/qwenpaw/app/approvals/service.py` provides current approval-routing evidence that must be converged into durable confirmation evidence under the owning `src/qwenpaw/security` contract.
- indirect implementation chain: `src/qwenpaw/app/inbox_trace_store.py` provides append-only trace evidence that must be converged into canonical audit-chain projection under the owning `src/qwenpaw/security` contract.
- direct architecture boundary materialization: `deploy/ARCHITECTURE.md` realizes the stable repository-owned collaboration contract for `intent-security-center` and `intent-cloud-integrity-stub` while preserving cloud-side process separation from the edge runtime.
- direct sub-boundary materialization: `deploy/api/ARCHITECTURE.md` freezes the Security Center backend HTTP API service consumed by the edge runtime and operator web, including SSE or WebSocket alert publication, nonce voucher APIs, and shadow-hash divergence timeline delivery.
- direct sub-boundary materialization: `deploy/api/ARCHITECTURE.md` freezes the Security Center backend HTTP API service consumed by the edge runtime and operator web, including the lease registry, TTL expiry downgrade path, reconnect recovery gate, SSE or WebSocket alert publication, nonce voucher APIs, and shadow-hash divergence timeline delivery.
- direct sub-boundary materialization: `deploy/web/ARCHITECTURE.md` freezes the operator-facing Security Center web frontend that visualizes anomalies, rejected events, recovery state, hash-break curve forks, and nonce-driven red alerts.
- direct implementation boundary: `deploy/api/ARCHITECTURE.md` owns `intent-security-event-ingestion-v1`, `intent-security-event`, and `intent-security-event-failure-record` for V1 event intake, configuration validation, durable-before-success accepted-event persistence, failure reception records, list/detail query APIs, persistence-error semantics, idempotency, and bounded oversized invalid payload summaries.
- direct implementation boundary: `deploy/web/ARCHITECTURE.md` owns `intent-security-event-inbox-web` by consuming deploy/api list/detail APIs only; it renders receivedAt-descending inbox rows, filters, configured list fields, stable detail URLs, undefined fields, and bounded read-only raw payload without Web configuration editing.
- direct configuration materialization: `deploy/config/security-event-contracts.v1.json` realizes `intent-security-event-contract-config` and is the frozen V1 configuration baseline for `sourceSystem`, `eventTypeId`, `schemaVersion`, payload field labels/types/required flags/enums/max lengths/list flags, and bounded failure/raw display limits.
- direct testcase materialization: `tests/integration/security/test_audit_foundation.py::test_end_to_end_non_repudiation_evidence_chain` is the read-only explicit entrypoint for `sec-e2e-024-end-to-end-non-repudiation-evidence-chain`, and it must run through the real `app_server` fixture rather than repository source inspection.
- direct testcase materialization: `tests/integration/security/test_audit_foundation.py::test_audit_integrity_self_healing_lockdown` is the read-only explicit entrypoint for `sec-e2e-025-audit-integrity-self-healing-lockdown`.
- direct testcase materialization detail: `sec-e2e-025-audit-integrity-self-healing-lockdown` now freezes the historical tamper branch where three high-risk records are created, the second committed non-tail record is edited by operating-system means, the next high-risk boundary must enter `UNTRUSTED`, and Security Center backend/web must remain recovery-required rather than `CLEAR` until cloud-validated full-chain recovery.
- direct testcase materialization: `tests/integration/security/test_audit_foundation.py::test_lease_expiry_blocks_untrusted_rejoin_until_gap_sync` is the read-only explicit entrypoint for `sec-e2e-027-lease-expiry-active-defense`, and its implementation-architecture contract freezes one entrypoint with two control points plus two distinct console observation points: `pre_recovery_console_status` for the denied rejoin frame before missing-gap verification and `post_recovery_console_status` for the restored-access frame after continuity validation.
- direct testcase materialization: `tests/integration/security/test_audit_foundation.py::test_normal_offline_reconnect_clears_without_gap_recovery` is the read-only explicit entrypoint for `sec-e2e-028-normal-offline-reconnect-clear-state`, and its implementation-architecture contract freezes the non-incident reconnect branch: trusted audit head, normal offline stop, same canonical client restarted before lease expiry, Security Center backend/web projecting `ALIGNED` or `TRUSTED` with `gap_status=CLEAR`, `recovery_gate_status=CLEAR`, `recovery_required=false`, and ordinary model access `200`.
- direct testcase materialization: `tests/integration/security/test_audit_foundation.py::test_prompt_injection_cannot_bypass_high_risk_tool_guard` is the read-only explicit entrypoint for `sec-e2e-021-prompt-injection-tool-guard-enforced`.
- direct testcase materialization: `tests/integration/security/test_security_event_ingestion.py::test_accepts_legal_event_after_persistence` is the read-only explicit entrypoint for `sec-event-ingestion-v1-accept-legal-event`.
- direct testcase materialization: `tests/integration/security/test_security_event_ingestion.py::test_rejects_invalid_event_config_boundary` is the read-only explicit entrypoint for `sec-event-ingestion-v1-reject-invalid-config-boundary`.
- direct testcase materialization: `tests/integration/security/test_security_event_ingestion.py::test_preserves_undefined_payload_fields_in_detail_only` is the read-only explicit entrypoint for `sec-event-ingestion-v1-preserve-undefined-payload-fields`.
- direct testcase materialization: `tests/integration/security/test_security_event_ingestion.py::test_enforces_source_event_id_idempotency` is the read-only explicit entrypoint for `sec-event-ingestion-v1-enforce-idempotency`.
- direct testcase materialization: `tests/e2e/security_center/test_security_event_inbox.py::test_web_lists_filters_and_opens_event_detail` is the read-only explicit entrypoint for `sec-event-ingestion-v1-render-web-list-and-detail`.
- direct testcase materialization: `tests/integration/security/test_security_event_ingestion.py::test_records_failed_receptions_without_business_event_pollution` is the read-only explicit entrypoint for `sec-event-ingestion-v1-bound-failure-records`.

## Critical Non-Explicit Guardrails
- tests/architecture/root-architecture-contracts.test.js guards the presence and cross-reference integrity of the root contracts, including the new security contracts.
- tests/architecture/root-architecture-deliverables.test.js guards that the expected architecture deliverables exist at stable repository paths.
- tests/architecture/validator-bootstrap-traceability.test.js guards the wiring between `package.json` validation commands and bundled validator assets.
- tests/architecture/security-audit-contract-boundaries.test.js guards the frozen boundary between `src/qwenpaw/security`, the explicit security entrypoint zone, the separate Security Center deployment boundary, and the root/runtime/test contracts that reference them.
- tests/architecture/security-explicit-entrypoint-traceability.test.js guards that `sec-e2e-024`, `sec-e2e-025`, `sec-e2e-027`, `sec-e2e-028`, `sec-e2e-021`, and `sec-e2e-029` stay mounted to the read-only explicit entrypoints and that the implementation handoff keeps the same paths plus frozen execution-state traceability for open security gaps.
- tests/architecture/security-event-ingestion-contract-boundaries.test.js guards that Security Event Ingestion V1 stays mounted to `deploy/api`, `deploy/web`, `deploy/config/security-event-contracts.v1.json`, `tests/integration/security/test_security_event_ingestion.py`, `tests/integration/security/security_event_harness.py`, and `tests/e2e/security_center/test_security_event_inbox.py` with expected failing handoff entries until Coding/Repair implements the production behavior.
