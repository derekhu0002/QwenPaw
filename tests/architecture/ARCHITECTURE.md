## Implementation Architecture Contract

### Responsibility
- Hold critical non-explicit tests that guard architecture-deliverable traceability, validator bootstrap integrity, the new security audit boundary, and explicit-entrypoint traceability.

### Children
- path: root-architecture-contracts.test.js
  kind: critical-non-explicit-test
  role: verifies that the root contract and required local contracts remain present and referenced
- path: root-architecture-deliverables.test.js
  kind: critical-non-explicit-test
  role: verifies that the expected architecture deliverables exist at stable repository paths
- path: validator-bootstrap-traceability.test.js
  kind: critical-non-explicit-test
  role: verifies the root npm validation scripts still point to the bundled validator assets and required schema files
- path: security-audit-contract-boundaries.test.js
  kind: critical-non-explicit-test
  role: verifies the new security contract, explicit-entrypoint-zone contract, and protected harness files stay wired together
- path: security-explicit-entrypoint-traceability.test.js
  kind: critical-non-explicit-test
  role: verifies `sec-e2e-024` remains mounted to the declared explicit entrypoint, keeps its real-environment runtime-inspection shape, and preserves failure-record traceability
- path: security-runtime-client-identity-boundary.test.js
  kind: critical-non-explicit-test
  role: verifies sec-e2e-027 still uses one canonical Security Center client id across startup heartbeat, recovery, lockdown, and restored-access projection instead of splitting one live runtime into multiple cloud clients; the complementary live behavior guard lives in ../../tests/contract/security/test_lease_recovery_semantics_contract.py
- path: security-runtime-lease-persistence-boundary.test.js
  kind: critical-non-explicit-test
  role: verifies sec-e2e-027 still freezes lease_ttl_seconds into the Security Center API request contract and durable store instead of allowing overview/timeline to hide zero lease fields through projection-only fallback
