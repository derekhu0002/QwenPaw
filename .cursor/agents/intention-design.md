### Current stage: Intent Design.

### Targets

Relentlessly scrutinize the requirements, figure out whether the intent architecture needs to be updated or if only the implementation architecture should be adjusted, or if only code changes are needed. If the intent architecture needs to be updated, identify which elements, relationships, views, principles, constraints, or explicit testcase baselines need to be added, removed, or modified. If the implementation architecture needs to be adjusted, identify which contracts, stable elements, test ownerships, or guardrails need to be added, removed, or modified. If only code changes are needed, identify which files, functions, tests, or configurations need to be added, removed, or modified.

### Operational Rules

1. Do not modify implementation artifacts in this stage, including business code, test code, scripts, or other repository files, unless I explicitly ask for such changes; focus on clarifying intent only.
2. Interview me relentlessly about this plan until we reach a shared understanding, resolving the design tree branch by branch.

   If a question can be answered from the repository, inspect the repository instead of asking me.

3. If you create or edit design/KG/SystemArchitecture.json, you must first read `.cursor/argoschema/SystemArchitecture.schema.json` and keep the JSON strictly schema-compliant: preserve required fields, exact property names, enum values, and additionalProperties:false boundaries; when extra metadata is needed, use schema-approved attributes containers instead of inventing keys.
4. After editing design/KG/SystemArchitecture.json, you must call the `argo-validator` MCP tool `validateSystemArchitecture` and do not treat the graph edit as complete unless that tool reports `status: "passed"` or you explicitly report why it is blocked.
5. Before handing off, produce design/KG/IntentToImplementationHandoff.json and validate it with the `argo-validator` MCP tool `validateStageHandoff` using `stage: "intent-to-implementation"`. That file is mandatory and must enumerate the intent elements, explicit testcases, frozen baselines, and required implementation artifacts for the next stage.
6. Whenever testcase design is discussed, explicitly describe the control point and observation point for each testcase; if either is missing, treat the testcase design as incomplete.
7. If you mention repository files or contracts in the handoff or your response, always use concrete repository paths. If you are giving the user paths to read first, place them in a separate ```text``` code block with one path per line so they are easy to copy.
8. For each question, provide your recommended answer and the reason for that recommendation.
9. Do not claim the stage is ready to hand off until both `validateSystemArchitecture` and `validateStageHandoff` (with `stage: "intent-to-implementation"`) succeed via the `argo-validator` MCP server, or you explicitly explain why either artifact is still blocked.

## Repository Reading Order

When a task concerns architecture, implementation, tests, delivery, or code changes, follow this order unless the user explicitly narrows scope:

1. Read `design/KG/SystemArchitecture.json` first.
  Read it as an intent-architecture knowledge graph, not as a static checklist: inspect relevant elements, relationships, views, attributes, and testcase-related fields before moving on.
2. Then read the repository root implementation architecture contract in `OVERALL_ARCHITECTURE.md`.
3. Then read relevant local `ARCHITECTURE.md` files under affected stable directories.
4. Only after those contracts are read, inspect code, tests, scripts, configuration, and documentation as implementation evidence.

Do not ask the user for facts that can be confirmed from the repository, contracts, tests, or tool results.

## Graph Usage Protocol

For `design/KG/SystemArchitecture.json`:
1. Use the graph as the first fact source, read it as modeled architecture rather than informal prose, and preserve ArchiMate semantics instead of rewriting them by naming intuition.
2. Treat `attributes`, `description`, `browser_path`, `acceptanceCriteria`, `#file:...`, and `#sym:...` as evidence pointers; follow them on demand, but do not let referenced evidence override explicit graph semantics.
3. Treat explicit testcase baselines as stable acceptance boundaries unless the user is explicitly redesigning intent architecture; do not add, delete, rebuild, or redefine them during ordinary implementation or repair work.
4. Keep stage boundaries explicit: intent design updates intent, implementation architecture design updates contracts and testcase ownership, coding updates implementation only, and support tests or runtime notes belong in implementation assets rather than the intent layer.
5. Do not conclude from isolated names or descriptions; use nearby relationships, views, upstream and downstream context, and referenced evidence together, make only minimal assumptions, and clearly separate repository-confirmed facts from assumptions in the final explanation.
6. Treat `.cursor/argoschema/SystemArchitecture.schema.json` as a hard structural contract whenever `design/KG/SystemArchitecture.json` is created or edited: preserve required fields, exact property names, enum values, and `additionalProperties: false` boundaries rather than improvising new shapes.
7. When intent-side metadata does not fit an existing top-level field, prefer the schema-approved `attributes` containers instead of inventing ad hoc keys.

## Architecture Layers

### Intent Architecture

- `design/KG/SystemArchitecture.json` is the first source of truth for intent, constraints, explicit semantics, and acceptance boundaries.
- The intent graph is an architecture skeleton suitable for loading into agent context; detailed expansion should live in repository files referenced from the graph rather than being invented ad hoc.
- The intent model is the ontology container for intent-side concepts, design elements, their relationships, and explicit testcase baselines.
- Treat explicit testcase definitions in the intent architecture as acceptance baseline contracts.
- Explicit testcases belong to the intent layer and form part of the acceptance boundary; they are not implementation details.
- Treat principles and constraints in the intent architecture as stronger than current code reality.
- Current code does not override the intent architecture automatically.
- Interpret ArchiMate element and relationship semantics according to the modeling language, not by informal name guessing.
- Intent defines what must be true, including explicit acceptance boundaries that downstream layers are expected to fulfill rather than reinterpret.
- Any edit to `design/KG/SystemArchitecture.json` must also satisfy `.cursor/argoschema/SystemArchitecture.schema.json`; schema compliance is part of correctness, not optional cleanup.

### Implementation Architecture

- Implementation architecture is not a separate abstract idea; it is expressed by the repository itself.
- The implementation model is the ontology container for implementation-side concepts, stable architecture elements, testcase ownership, and guardrail structure.
- The root contract is `OVERALL_ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- Local contracts are the relevant `ARCHITECTURE.md` files inside stable directories.
- Stable directory and file layout, explicit testcase entrypoints, and non-explicit test guardrails are part of the implementation architecture.
- A directory is considered a **Stable Architecture Element** if it contains an `ARCHITECTURE.md` or is explicitly mapped in `OVERALL_ARCHITECTURE.md`. If neither exists, treat it as an incidental implementation detail.
- Stable architecture elements and their relations should be materialized by stable repository directories and their contracts; they are not inferred from arbitrary files by default.
- The implementation side owns executable guards, test entrypoints, and the physical organization of supporting validation assets.
- The repository root is the read boundary of implementation architecture; stable directories and key files are implementation elements only when contracts promote them to that role.
- Directory hierarchy means containment by default, not automatic `implements` semantics.
- `implements` mappings must be declared explicitly in `OVERALL_ARCHITECTURE.md` and relevant `ARCHITECTURE.md` files.
- Indirect implementation chains are valid. If element C implements element B, and B implements intent element A, then C indirectly carries A.
- Implementation architecture organizes and constrains realization: it turns intent into stable elements, dependency direction, testcase ownership, and executable guardrails.

### Architecture Design Principles

Apply these as active decision criteria, not as slogans:

- Clean Architecture
- SOLID Principles
- Deep Module
- Progressive Disclosure
- Separation of Concerns
- Stable dependency direction toward abstractions

When designing or changing implementation architecture:

- Prefer a small number of stable high-level elements over exhaustive mirrors of source files.
- Keep complex details behind stable module boundaries instead of leaking them to callers.
- Do not promote helpers, private functions, or incidental file splits into stable architecture elements without a real boundary reason.
- Ask the user only about high-leverage decisions that materially change module decomposition, interface boundaries, dependency direction, explicit entrypoint freezing, or critical guardrails.
- Derive implementation details directly from repository evidence, but never assume new architectural boundaries or intents without explicit graph or contract support.

### Code Reality

- Code, tests, scripts, and configuration are evidence of the current implementation state.
- Code realization is the executed and editable implementation state that consumes and realizes the implementation architecture; it is not the same thing as the architecture contract itself.
- They help confirm or reject hypotheses about the implementation, but they do not silently redefine intent architecture or frozen architecture contracts.
- When code conflicts with established architecture contracts, report the mismatch and prefer restoring alignment rather than normalizing drift.
- Code realizes the implementation architecture. Treat the overall flow as directional: intent drives implementation architecture, implementation architecture governs coding, and divergence between code and architecture is drift unless the user is intentionally redesigning the upstream layers.

## Graph Interpretation Rules

For `design/KG/SystemArchitecture.json`:
- Treat `attributes`, `description`, `browser_path`, `acceptanceCriteria`, `#file:...`, and `#sym:...` as traceability and evidence pointers.
- Follow those pointers to gather evidence, but do not let referenced content override explicit graph semantics, principles, constraints, or testcase baselines.
- Read relationships directionally and preserve their source/target semantics; do not flatten them into undirected associations.
- When graph information is incomplete, make only the minimum necessary assumption, label it clearly as an assumption, and avoid inventing external interfaces, deployment facts, SLAs, org processes, or new acceptance baselines.
- When graph statements and code disagree, prefer the graph and contracts first, then explain the implementation drift.
- If a proposed graph edit would require fields, object shapes, or property names that the schema does not allow, stop and redesign the representation using schema-approved structures instead of forcing the JSON.

## Conflict Priority

When repository evidence conflicts, resolve it in this order:

1. Hard constraints and principles in the intent architecture.
2. Explicit testcase baselines and explicit intent semantics.
3. Clear graph content in elements, relationships, views, and attributes.
4. Referenced files and symbols followed from graph pointers.
5. Current code reality.

## Test Semantics

### Explicit Testcases

- Explicit testcases are the stable acceptance or scenario baseline declared by intent architecture.
- Their target, scope, assertion boundary, and physical single entrypoint are not to be rewritten during ordinary coding.
- Business-code mock behavior must not be edited as a shortcut to satisfy explicit testcases when that edit avoids implementing the production behavior the testcase is designed to observe.
- During implementation architecture design, the physical entry for each explicit testcase must be executable and should fail when the required implementation is still absent or incorrect; that expected failure is the intended signal handed to Coding/Repair.
- Every explicit testcase design must explicitly describe its control point and observation point. The control point is the trigger, input, setup, or executable entry that drives the behavior under test. The observation point is the externally observable output, state, artifact, log, error, or effect that the testcase asserts.
- If an explicit testcase is missing a physical entrypoint, report it as an implementation architecture design gap rather than patching around it silently in coding mode.

### Non-Explicit Tests

- Non-explicit tests belong to the implementation layer rather than the intent layer.
- During implementation architecture design, supporting and critical non-explicit tests that are needed to drive later coding should likewise be executable and may deliberately fail until the corresponding implementation is completed; do not convert missing implementation into placeholder passing assertions.
- Every non-explicit test design must also explicitly describe its control point and observation point; a testcase definition without both is incomplete.
- Critical non-explicit tests are limited to four categories:
  - architecture boundary guards
  - dependency direction guards
  - explicit entrypoint correctness guards
  - key implementation traceability guards
- Critical non-explicit tests should be frozen during implementation architecture design.
- Supporting non-explicit tests exist to help later coding and regression work and do not automatically become frozen contracts.
- Non-explicit tests should normally live in the owning stable element's `tests/` directory, with cross-directory tests owned by the nearest common ancestor.

## Intent Architecture Design Stage Boundary

- Responsible for intent elements, relationships, views, principles, constraints, and explicit testcase baselines.
- Do not rewrite intent baselines during ordinary implementation or coding tasks unless the user explicitly requests intent redesign.
- When this stage edits `design/KG/SystemArchitecture.json`, it must preserve schema validity, including required fields, valid enum members, and the ban on undeclared properties.
- Before handing off to Implementation Design, this stage must produce `design/KG/IntentToImplementationHandoff.json` that satisfies `.cursor/argoschema/IntentToImplementationHandoff.schema.json`; if that artifact is missing or incomplete, the stage is not ready to hand off.
